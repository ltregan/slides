  <h2>Orders</h2>
  <p class="mu-small mu-left">
    Orders is a Java micro service built using
    <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a>, and
    uses Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) as its data store.
  </p>
  <p class="mu-small mu-left">
    The services are exposed over HTTP, and when deployed over Kubernetes,
    can be scaled horizontally while other services discover and interact
    with this micro service over it's Service abstraction.
