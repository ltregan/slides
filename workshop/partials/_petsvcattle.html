        <b>Pets</b>: Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique
        systems that
        can never be down.
        Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”.
      </p>
      <p class="mu-left">
        <b>Cattle</b>: Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated
        tools, and are
        designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable.
        Typically,
        during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits
        attributes
        of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data.

        <li>Pets vs. Cattle</li>
        <li>Traditional systems are long lived, and the standard practice is to keep updating and reconfiguring them - hard to keep track of the changes over long periods, hard to rebuild</li>
        <li>Ephemeral systems are immutable, you never update, you replace. Use automation to do this effectively. All changes are tracked, usually in code. Rebuilding the server is a common occurence, its neither hard nor do we have uncertainty  </li>

        <li>Why cloud native applications should be designed to take advantage of the cloud.</li>
