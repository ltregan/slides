        <b>Pets</b>: Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique
        systems that
        can never be down.
        Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”.
      </p>
      <p class="mu-left">
        <b>Cattle</b>: Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated
        tools, and are
        designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable.
        Typically,
        during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits
        attributes
        of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data.
