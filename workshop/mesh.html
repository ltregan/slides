              <p class="mu-small">The term service mesh is used to describe the network of microservices that make up such applications and the interactions between them. As a service mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage. Its requirements can include discovery, load balancing, failure recovery, metrics, and monitoring. A service mesh also often has more complex operational requirements, like A/B testing, canary releases, rate limiting, access control, and end-to-end authentication.</p>

                Decrease the coupling between application code, platform and policy. This makes services easier to imnplement and move between environments or to new policy schemes. <br/>Result = more portable applications.
