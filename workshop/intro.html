                <b>Pets</b> : Servers or server pairs that are treated as indispensable or unique
                systems that
                can never be down.
                Typically they are manually built, managed, and “hand fed”.

              <p class="mu-left">
                <b>Cattle</b> : Arrays of more than two servers, that are built using automated
                tools, and are
                designed for failure, where no one, two, or even three servers are irreplaceable.
                Typically,
                during failure events no human intervention is required as the array exhibits
                attributes
                of “routing around failures” by restarting failed servers or replicating data.
